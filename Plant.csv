The Darth Vader Flower exudes a faint, musky fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators, such as moths and bats. This scent, combined with its dark color, aids in its reproduction by drawing in creatures of the night. In folklore, the Darth Vader Flower is believed to have protective properties, warding off evil spirits and negative energy. It is often planted near entrances or in sacred spaces to harness its perceived power. Additionally, its exotic and dramatic appearance makes it a favorite in fantasy-themed gardens and collections.","Fantasy plants","aristolochia-salvadorensis","","","false","true","aristolochia-salvadorensis","standard","readyForReview","Embedded","2024-06-01T08:34:11.509Z","2024-06-02T10:07:09.576Z",1,"aristolochiaSalvadorensis_variant1","aristolochiaSalvadorensis_variant1","https://images.cdn.europe-west1.gcp.commercetools.com/f1bf5462-8ac1-45ad-893a-84ad3438eb99/%D0%94%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82-%D0%92%D0%B5%D0%B9%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%80-Aristolo-BacoN2ou.jpg||565x552;https://images.cdn.europe-west1.gcp.commercetools.com/f1bf5462-8ac1-45ad-893a-84ad3438eb99/20140306150640_0-E-jj6jvb.jpg||605x597;https://images.cdn.europe-west1.gcp.commercetools.com/f1bf5462-8ac1-45ad-893a-84ad3438eb99/Flowers-8-ivscsDPO.jpg||721x767","EUR 14000","true","true","false","false","true","S",""
